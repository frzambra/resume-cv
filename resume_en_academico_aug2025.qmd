# Summary

Spatial data scientist and researcher with over ten years of experience. My work focuses on understanding climate variability, drought monitoring, and water resource management through remote sensing and geospatial and climate data analysis. I hold a PhD in agricultural engineering—which does not define me—and have published on vegetation dynamics, long-term droughts, land-use change, and water efficiency. My research seeks to contribute to both academic knowledge and practical decision-making to address the water crisis and strengthen climate resilience by integrating science, data, and public policy into sustainable solutions.
